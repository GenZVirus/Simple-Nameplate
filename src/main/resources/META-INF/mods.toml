This mod adds the possibility of editing the nameplate colors for each individual player. It also adds a border around the nameplate.

Nameplates can now have any color. You can edit the text color, background color and the border color as well as the transparency for each. Shifting/sneaking now hides completely the nameplate. It is also hidden from if a solid block is in front of the nameplate.
The colors can be edited with commands. Commands have different level of permissions. There are commands for Admins which allows them to change the color of a specific player and there are commands that allow players to customize their own nameplate. The amount of color a player can give for each of the primary colors in ARGB format is between 0 and 255.

Admin commands:
/sn player set TextColor <Red Amount> <Green Amount> <Blue Amount> <Alpha amount>
/sn player set BGColor <Red Amount> <Green Amount> <Blue Amount> <Alpha amount>
/sn player set BorderColor <Red Amount> <Green Amount> <Blue Amount> <Alpha amount>

Player commands:
/sn set TextColor <Red Amount> <Green Amount> <Blue Amount> <Alpha amount>
/sn set BGColor <Red Amount> <Green Amount> <Blue Amount> <Alpha amount>
/sn set BorderColor <Red Amount> <Green Amount> <Blue Amount> <Alpha amount>
